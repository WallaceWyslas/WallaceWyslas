### ðŸ“„ About me:
Hey!
I have a degree in Civil Engineering and am currently trying to transition my career to **DevOps**.
In 2019 I started working with Unreal Engine, in which I worked with games, metaverse, digital twins and other experiences. After that, I was more involved with digital services work teams, with experience in repositories, documentation and pipelines.
